**ARE YOU RAYDEE TO AUGMENT YOUR BORWSING ?**
(with User JS, user JavaScript, Greasemonkey scripts, **userscripts**, user scripts, etc.)

A userscript, is a piece of JavaScript code that runs on your PC or mobile
and that enhances existing websites, for you.
They can display additional information,
they can make repetitive tedious tasks more easy, fast and efficient!

It’s like cheat codes for web sites, like the famous
[KONAMI COMMAND](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22KONAMI+COMMAND%22) /
[コナミコマンド](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22%E3%82%B3%E3%83%8A%E3%83%9F%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%22) !

> I encourage you to write your own userscripts for the
> websites you frequently use but are not completely satisfied with.
> It’s so powerful and it can make you save so much time in many cases.

In this repo I store my userscripts,
mostly for [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org),
but not only.


HOW TO USE USERSCRIPTS
----------------------

### BROWSER USERSCRIPT SUPPORT ###

First thing you should do is make sure your browser supports a userscripts extension / add‐on.
Here is a list where it is possible:

- Android
  - Kiwi Browser
  - <del>Firefox 68.11.0</del> <ins>(**obsolete: security risks**)</ins>
- iOS
  - :x: None
- Linux and Windows
  - Firefox
  - All Chromium derivates (Vivaldi, Chrome, etc.)
- Mac OS
  - Safari

As for the extension / add‐on, I advise [**Violentmonkey**](https://violentmonkey.github.io),
which is the only one to be both **multi‐browser** and **open source**.
I think on Mac OS with Safari, you may have to use **Tampermonkey**, which is also nice to use, but not **open source**.


### INSTALLING USERSCRIPTS IN BROWSER ###

Install my userscripts from this **jesus2099/konami-command** GitHub repo, directly:

1. Click on a userscript `*.user.js` file link to review its description and code
2. Click on the **Raw** button to install
   (on mobile, you must first click on the “…” ellipsis button to see **Raw** menu item)

> **Hint**: If you install the userscript called [INSTALL USER SCRIPT](https://github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/blob/master/INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT.user.js),
> you will get a direct download/install
> ![monkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/raw/1d911bffd7d4c37f82b5bcdada16f0b79fe0a70a/src/public/images/icon16.png)
> **monkey** icon button in front of each userscript file, making them installable in a single click.
> It works in GitHub, in GitLab and in Bitbucket file listings.
